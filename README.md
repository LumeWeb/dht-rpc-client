# dht-rpc-client
A client library that uses hypercore and the https://github.com/LumeWeb/relay server along with Skynet for web, to perform `Wisdom of the crowd` RPC requests.

This enables access to blockchain RPC without running a node, and socializes the cost of access to RPC from use of services such as https://pokt.dht 

As demand grows for users, so should the community. It is expected that both businesses operating on web3 and community members donating/supporting in altruism will ensure the upkeep of this dht.

It is the projects hope that blockchains will evolve in the future such that much of this infrastructure becomes unneeded and RPC can be done directly with light clients. This would also need to support over Websockets like how Webtorrent works.

As very few blockchains actually support this and for use with decentralized nodes, this type of dht/technology is required for mainstream adoption.
